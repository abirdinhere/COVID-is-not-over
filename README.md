# COVID 19 is not over (and that sucks)

Dear friends and family,

We all wish the COVID pandemic was actually over and that we don't have to worry about it any more. The reality is that there is a severe lack of information being given to the public in the interest of protecting business in the short term. This repo seeks to aggregate up-to-date info on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic and what the public response should be. I will use mostly reputable sources with memes peppered in.

How do I know this is actually a problem?
lorem ipsum blah blah

## Fallacies
### We have to live with COVID now, that's just how it is
### I'm not that worried about it, it's not a big deal
### If I get it I get it, it's gonna be around
### If it were really a problem, the gov't would be doing something about it
### I got COVID before and my symptoms were mild
### I developed natural immunity cause I've had COVID already
### I don't have to mask because I'm a healthy adult and that's only for immunocompromised folks
### Masks don't work anyway
### Aren't you being a little paranoid?

## Current affairs
### airbone; like smoke
### wastewater data
### long covid studies

## Long COVID
Long COVID is one of the biggest reasons to observe and maintain appropriate social distancing measures

## Practical Mitigations
Obvs vaccine and stuff. talk about it being airborne, when and where to mask, when and where to test

## Hope for the future
* Allergy meds
* Pepcid


## tl;dr
* The pandemic isn't over. In fact, transmission rates are not much different than when we were in lockdown. Please resume prior protective measures.
* COVID is NOT and has never been like the flu. We should aim to ensure that COVID does not become endemic like the flu is now.
* Contracting COVID and experiencing "Mild symptoms" is not a quality indicator of the damage the virus does to your critical systems
* Take a daily allergy like claritin/zyrtec
* Don't trust the CDC's recommendations on COVID; they have been relaxed for the purpose of avoiding short-term damage to the economy. Use WHO instead.
