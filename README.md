# COVID 19 is not over (and that sucks), an open letter

Dear friends and family,

We all wish the COVID pandemic was actually over and that we don't have to worry about it any more. The public assumption is that we're just going to have COVID around, much like the flu, we'll get boosters as they come out and otherwise operate like the pandemic is effectively over. Often you'll hear the pandemic referred to in past tense. Unfortunately, the pandemic is far from over. The reality is that there is a **severe lack of information** readily available to the public. This is intentional, with the interest of protecting business and the economy. (If we act like things are normal maybe they will be) I created this repo as an open letter and a resource for current, factual information. I will provide reputable sources with memes peppered in.

How do I know this is actually a problem?

## Fallacies and misinformation
### We have to live with COVID now, that's just how it is
### I'm not that worried about it, it's not a big deal
### If I get it I get it, it's gonna be around
### If it were really a problem, the gov't would be doing something about it
### If it were really a problem, I'd see more about it in the media
Don't trust the CDC's, or the news' recommendations on COVID. For the purpose of avoiding short-term damage to the economy, they've relaxed restrictions, and media 'takes' should be regarded with skepticism. Use WHO instead; they do not have any political or economic bias that would prevent them from delivering the raw truth.
### I got COVID before and my symptoms were mild
### I developed natural immunity cause I've had COVID already
### I don't have to mask because I'm a healthy adult and that's only for immunocompromised folks
### Masks don't work anyway
This is unfortunately inaccurate and over-generalized. The missing detail is that there are *varying* levels of effectiveness of masks. The ones you heard were ineffective are referring to the cloth, or commonly seen blue surgical masks. The reason they were discovered to be ineffective is because we learned that COVID is airborne, and lingers in the air like smoke. Cloth and surgical masks are effective more or less as a spit guard.
### Death rates are down
This is definitely good news, but it doesn't capture the whole picture. Long COVID will debilitate a significant portion of the population, or may have already. Immune systems are weakening. Pulmonory systems are failing. Nervous system and the brain are struggling to be effective. Sexual dysfunction. 
### Aren't you being a little paranoid?

## Current affairs
### wastewater data, transmission rates compared to a specific date for shock value
transmission rates higher than x% of the pandemic. # of cases is derived from wastewater data and extrapolating upon reported numbers.
### airbone; like smoke. this is one of the reasons those blue surgical masks were considered ineffective; they were designed to keep out liquid, not gas. N95 and KN95 masks were designed to keep out gas. They are considered considerably more effective than any cloth or surgical mask. Basically, if it's loose-fitting, it's not protecting you much. Despite that the other kinds of masks were considered ineffective, any cloth or mask is *still* better than no mask.
### long covid studies
This is as big of a concern as COVID itself, and the death rates are not a good indicator of the problems that COVID is causing. Chronic conditions don't show up in the death numbers for COVID.

## Long COVID
Long COVID is one of the biggest reasons to observe and maintain appropriate social distancing measures

## Practical Mitigations
Obvs vaccine and stuff. talk about it being airborne, when and where to mask, when and where to test
Mask indoors, when walking down busy streets, at drive-thrus. Think, "if someone around me was smoking a cigarette, would I be able to smell it?" and if the answer is yes, COVID can hang in the air much like stale cigar smoke. It can be present hours after the air is initially exposed to it. 

## Hope for the future
* Allergy meds
* Pepcid
* 

## What else can you do?
Ask others to mask. 
For US folk link to finding representatives
Let's be real, it'll probably be more effective to reach some of your favorite celebrities on social media. Have them make masking cool
Feature masks in some of your selfies
Meme about it. Grieve about it. Just don't forget about it. We can be resolute in our approach, and remain curious about possible paths forward.

## tl;dr
* The pandemic isn't over. In fact, transmission rates are not much different than when we were in lockdown. Please resume prior protective measures.
* COVID is NOT and has never been like the flu. We should aim to ensure that COVID does not become endemic like the flu is now.
* Contracting COVID and experiencing "Mild symptoms" is not a quality indicator of the damage the virus does to your critical systems
* Even if you take no other precautions take a daily allergy like claritin/zyrtec
* Don't trust the CDC's, or the news' recommendations on COVID. For the purpose of avoiding short-term damage to the economy, they've relaxed restrictions, and media 'takes' should be regarded with skepticism. Use WHO instead; they do not have any political or economic bias that would prevent them from delivering the raw truth.
