# COVID 19 is not over (and that sucks); an open letter to friends, family, and the community at large

Dear friends and family,

We all wish the COVID pandemic was over and that we don't have to worry about it any more. The public assumption is that we're just going to have COVID around, much like the flu, we'll get boosters as they come out and otherwise operate like the pandemic is effectively over. Often you'll hear the pandemic referred to in past tense. Unfortunately, the pandemic is far from over. The reality is that there is a **severe lack of information** readily available to the public. This is intentional, with the interest of protecting business and the economy. (If we act like things are normal maybe they will be) I created this repo to store current, factual information on the pandemic and related topics. I will provide reputable sources, and memes..


## Fallacies and misinformation
### We have to live with COVID now, that's just how it is / If I get it I get it / I'm not that worried about it / It's not a big deal

### I got COVID before and my symptoms were mild
Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, the experience of _having_ COVID (especially for someone who is vaccinated) does not communicate to your body the severity of its effects on your system. More often than not, for relatively-healthy individuals, having COVID feels like a small cold. It's easy to conclude that "because it didn't feel that bad, it must not _be_ that bad." The effects of Long COVID are far more insidious and difficult to detect, ranging from brain fog to debilitating chronic disorders.
### It's only really bad for the elderly and the already-sick
This is not true for the same reasons that having mild symptoms does not equate to mild damage. The effects on the elderly and already-sick are only more obvious.

### If it were really a problem, the gov't would be doing something about it
It is unfortunate that this is not the case. The government has taken its position on COVID: that "it will be around", effectively putting its head in the sand--its recommendation does not consider the information that we now have about COVID, so the response has been slow and ineffective. The government is trying to avoid a disruption of labor and keep businesses from suffering losses due to maintaining vacant office buildings and the consequences of social distancing. See more on the government response [here](docs/US_government_response.md).
### If it were really a problem, I'd see more about it in the media
Don't trust the CDC's, or the news' recommendations on COVID. For the purpose of avoiding short-term damage to the economy, they've relaxed restrictions, and media 'takes' should be regarded with skepticism. Use WHO instead; they do not have any political or economic bias that would prevent them from delivering the raw truth.
### I developed natural immunity cause I've had COVID already
### I don't have to mask because I'm a healthy adult and I'm vaccinated. That's only for immunocompromised folks or people who are sick
This is a recommendation from the CDC that neglects to mention that after you get sick, especially with COVID, you remain immunocompromised for some undefined period of time (body-dependent). While you may be *unlikely* to contract COVID if you are a healthy adult, you may become a carrier if you choose not to mask.
### Masks don't work anyway
This is unfortunately inaccurate and over-generalized. The missing detail is that there are *varying* levels of effectiveness of masks. The ones you heard were ineffective are referring to the cloth, or commonly seen blue surgical masks. The reason they were discovered to be ineffective is because we learned that COVID is airborne, and lingers in the air like smoke. Cloth and surgical masks are effective more or less as a spit guard.
### Death rates are down
This is definitely good news, but it doesn't capture the whole picture. Long COVID will debilitate a significant portion of the population, or may have already. Immune systems are weakening. Pulmonory systems are failing. Nervous system and the brain are struggling to be effective. Sexual dysfunction. 
### Nobody else is doing it/what if I'm the only one?
Don't be an [apathetic bystander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect). Nobody said this would be easy. Try your best not to crumble under the societal pressure of "keep calm and ignore COVID".

### Aren't you being a little paranoid?
Maybe, but this is a healthy paranoia. It is a thoroughly researched topic that, when understood, requires a certain level of concern to address. It is unreasonable to think that this paranoia is misplaced. The fewer people that observe these precautions, the more worrisome it becomes.

## Current affairs
We now know a whole lot more about how this virus transmits, and the effects it can have on people and the community at large. Here are some things that you might not have known:
### wastewater data, transmission rates
transmission rates higher than x% of the pandemic. # of cases is derived from wastewater data and extrapolating upon reported numbers. As of 7/26, there is more transmission today than during 69% of the pandemic. Remember what it was like on /some date/. You knew at that time that it was not safe to go out and socialize. It is no different now--in fact, we know more now than we did then. We should be *more* concerned than we were, but instead we have no restrictions in place.
### airbone; like smoke. this is one of the reasons those blue surgical masks were considered ineffective; they were designed to keep out liquid, not gas. N95 and KN95 masks were designed to keep out gas. They are considered considerably more effective than any cloth or surgical mask. Basically, if it's loose-fitting, it's not protecting you much. Despite that the other kinds of masks were considered ineffective, any cloth or mask is *still* better than no mask.
### long covid studies
This is as big of a concern as COVID itself, and the death rates are not a good indicator of the problems that COVID is causing. Chronic conditions don't show up in the death numbers for COVID.

## Long COVID
Long COVID is one of the biggest reasons to observe and maintain appropriate social distancing measures.
See the [Long COVID page](docs/Long_COVID.md) for infographics and links to sources.

## You might not know...
#### Your pets can get COVID
And you might not know they have it because they don't always show symptoms
#### 


## Preventative measures
### Vaccines
Obvs vaccine and stuff. talk about it being airborne, when and where to mask, when and where to test
Mask indoors, when walking down busy streets, at drive-thrus. Think, "if someone around me was smoking a cigarette, would I be able to smell it?" and if the answer is yes, COVID can hang in the air much like stale cigar smoke. It can be present hours after the air is initially exposed to it. 
### Masking
### When should I test?

### Hope for the future
* Allergy meds
  * There are preliminary studies suggesting that taking a daily allergy pill like Claritin or Zyrtec can assist your immune system in not allowing the virus to bind to the receptors, which may result in fewer infections.
* Pepcid
  * ?
* Mouthwash
  * ?
* Xylitol (sugar free mints/gum)
  * ?

## What else can you do?
Ask others to mask. 
For US folk link to finding representatives
Let's be real, it'll probably be more effective to reach some of your favorite celebrities on social media. Have them make masking cool
Feature masks in some of your selfies
Meme about it. Grieve about it. Just don't forget about it. We can be resolute in our approach, and remain curious about possible paths forward.

## tl;dr
* The pandemic isn't over. In fact, transmission rates are not much different than when we were in lockdown. Please resume prior protective measures.
* COVID is NOT and has never been like the flu. We should aim to ensure that COVID does not become endemic like the flu is now.
* Contracting COVID and experiencing "Mild symptoms" is not a quality indicator of the damage the virus does to your critical systems
* Even if you take no other precautions take a daily allergy like claritin/zyrtec
* Don't trust the CDC's, or the news' recommendations on COVID. For the purpose of avoiding short-term damage to the economy, they've relaxed restrictions, and media 'takes' should be regarded with skepticism. Use WHO instead; they do not have any political or economic bias that would prevent them from delivering the raw truth.
